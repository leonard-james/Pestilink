You are now responsible for refining and improving our existing Pest Management Web System. 
Do NOT create new features that do not exist unless explicitly stated. 
Your job is to improve, connect, polish, and refine what is already implemented.

========================================================
🌾 SYSTEM PURPOSE (Do NOT Change)
========================================================
The system helps farmers identify pests manually by:
- Browsing pests using the samples already stored in the system
- Viewing pest descriptions, biology, signs, prevention, treatment, and DIY remedies
- Viewing company services related to that pest
- Booking a service

NO AI is used. NO image upload for identification. 
Identification is based ONLY on the sample images and information already provided in the system.

========================================================
🌾 WHAT CURRENTLY EXISTS (IMPORTANT — DO NOT REMOVE)
========================================================
1. User types:
   - Company users
   - Farmers / Regular users
   - Admin

2. Existing working pages:
   - Dashboard(s)
   - Pest browsing page
   - Pest detail page (basic)
   - Company post creation page
   - Company dashboard
   - Booking system (basic)
   - Admin approval system (basic)
   - Navigation buttons and page routes (some connected, some not)

3. Existing system components:
   - Sample pest images
   - Static pest data (you must integrate the long pest information provided earlier)
   - Existing service creation form
   - Existing UI layout and components
   - Routing structure (Next.js)

Your task is to IMPROVE all of this — not replace it.

========================================================
🌾 NEW LOGIC TO IMPLEMENT (USING EXISTING PAGES)
========================================================

### 1. SERVICE–TO–PEST LINKING SYSTEM
Improve the existing company service post creation page by adding:

- A dropdown list OR searchable multi-select
- This allows companies to tag which pests their service covers
- The system must save this relation in the database

### 2. AUTO-DISPLAY SERVICES ON PEST PAGES
When a company tags a pest in their service post:

- The service should automatically appear on that pest’s page
- Farmers will see all companies that offer help for that specific pest

NO new pages should be created for this — only improve the existing pest detail page.

### 3. PEST INFORMATION INTEGRATION
Integrate the COMPLETE pest information dataset (31 pests) into the existing pest detail feature:

- Pest Name
- Description
- Biology
- Signs of Infestation
- Prevention
- Treatment
- DIY / Home Remedies
- Sample Pest Images (already exist in the system)
- List of Services for that Pest

This data must be structured cleanly and displayed properly.

### 4. UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS (IMPROVE EXISTING UI ONLY)
Improve the design of all screens WITHOUT changing the logic:

- Ensure consistent layout, spacing, and font hierarchy
- Improve card designs for pests and services
- Improve navigation bar & header/footer
- Ensure responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- Standardize button design across the whole system

### 5. FIX ALL BUTTONS AND ROUTES
Go through the entire codebase and:

- Identify buttons that do nothing
- Identify pages that are not connected
- Identify links that are broken or dead

Fix or implement the missing functionality BUT ONLY based on existing design intent.

For example:
If there is a “View Services” button but the route does not work:
→ Connect it properly to the correct page.

If there is a “Book Now” button:
→ Ensure it routes to the booking form.

### 6. BOOKING WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENT
Improve the existing booking system:

- When a user books a service, notify the admin (use existing notification logic)
- Admin should be able to approve or decline
- User sees the booking status updates

Do not replace — just improve.

========================================================
🌾 SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS (VERY IMPORTANT)
========================================================
❌ No new AI, classification, or detection features  
❌ No image upload feature for pest identification  
❌ Do NOT delete existing pages  
❌ Do NOT replace the system flow  
❌ Do NOT generate entirely new architecture

✔ Only improve and refine what exists  
✔ Add the missing connection between services and pests  
✔ Integrate the complete pest data provided  
✔ Polish UI, routing, and button logic  
✔ Make the system intuitive and professional

========================================================
🌾 EXPECTED OUTPUT FROM CURSOR
========================================================
Cursor must:

1. Improve the existing service creation page and add pest multi-select.
2. Modify database schema (only if necessary) to support service-to-pest mapping.
3. Improve pest detail page to show:
   - full pest info dataset
   - sample images
   - services linked to that pest
4. Improve UI layout across all pages.
5. Connect all broken buttons and routes.
6. Ensure dashboards work for:
   - Company
   - Farmer
   - Admin
7. Ensure booking workflow works end-to-end.
8. Clean and organize code where needed.
9. Preserve the entire flow of the system.

Start making improvements immediately. No summaries. No explanations. Only code changes and modifications.
